ghs-demangle
 by Alex Chadwick

A name demangler for the ghs compiler used on Wii U.

ghs-demangle takes in mangled C++ symbol names from an input file one line
at a time, demangles them, and outputs them to standard output. It can also
read its input from standard input, making it suitable for piping on Unix.
Any formatting errors will be reported on standard error. Erroring lines
are copied unaltered to the output.

The specification for the name mangling scheme was entirely guessed from
looking at output symbols, so this program may be inaccurate. The scheme
seems somewhat similar to a common one seen in a few compilers which
appears to have gone out of fashion. In particular, the GCC 2.9.x scheme
closely resembles the ghs one.

Contributions are more than welcome as new elements are encountered!
